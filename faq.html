                                      You should buy auto insurance before you begin driving, as it’s required in most states. Driving without insurance is often illegal and leaves you financially vulnerable.
                                    </p>

                                      Your car insurance coverage depends on the type of policy you purchase. Different types of car insurance include:
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Bodily injury (BI) and property damage (PD) liability coverage for damaged caused to other people or property.</li>
                                        <li>Personal injury protection (PIP) to cover medical expenses and other damages.</li>
                                        <li>Collision and comprehensive coverage for damage done to your vehicle in collisions, and in non-collisions (i.e., fire, vandalism, or theft).</li>
                                        <li>Uninsured and underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage protects in the event of an accident where the at-fault driver doesn’t have insurance.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="#">Does my car insurance cover other drivers ?</a>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>
                                      It depends on the specific policy. Your policy may have an “omnibus clause” that covers any driver who has permission to use your vehicle (known as permissive drivers). If an insured driver drives your vehicle, yours will be the primary insurance and theirs will offer secondary coverage.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      The best way to make sure that your car insurance covers another person is to have them listed as a named driver on the policy. Speak to someone at your insurance company before you let someone borrow your car if you’re unsure whether or not your specific policy will cover them.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                      In most states, some level of car insurance is required. The minimum amount of coverage may just be liability insurance, or it may include uninsured/underinsured motorist or additional medical coverage.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                      The most important thing to remember about filing an auto insurance claim is to make sure you call traffic officials first.
                                      That may sound crazy but making sure a situation is safe and the proper authorities have been notified is important.
                                      The insurance company is going to want to see a police report especially if there was another vehicle or someone else’s property involved in the accident.
                                      As far as when you should file. Calling the next day is fine but the sooner the better. Remember you can always call your independent insurance agent (Bridges Agency) to make sure the claims process is handled properly.
                                    </p>

                                      Taking a property insurance scheme can be tricky. One has to remain wary of the key exclusions within the policy at the same time bargain for the best deal at a cost effective price. To start with, take a policy that aligns with the key risks that your business may be susceptible to. Do not hesitate to pay extra property insurance premium for add on benefits as it will provide you extra protection against allied perils and dangers.

                                      Worker compensation policy does not cover any employee who is not a "workman within meaning of the Law(s)", any injury or an accident directly attributable to civil war, mutiny, insurrection and nuclear risk, insured's liability to employees of contractor to the insured, any liability of the insured which attaches by virtue of an agreement, any compensation for diseases mentioned in Part 'C' of Workmen's Compensation Act‐ 1923, unless specifically covered as an add-on

                                      Any injury or an accident leading to death of the worker during the course of employment is a fatal accident. Whereas, any injury or accident resulting in partial or permanent physical disablement such as loss of limb, loss of sight or hearing is defined as non-fatal accidents. Fatal Accidents Act 1855 is a law which provides a suit for compensation for such losses and which is covered under workmen compensation policy.

                                      As soon as the claim occurs, you should intimate the insurer and file the claim. Then you should submit all the required documents along with claim form. Once the documents are submitted, the insurer will appoint the surveyor to inspect your vehicle. Then your vehicle will be towed to the garage as required, and cost of repairing is estimated. Once all the evaluation and verification is done, the claim will be processed.
                                    </p>
